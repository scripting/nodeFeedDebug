#### nodeFeedDebug

This is a rude little app written in Node that I wrote quickly to do with a feed exactly what River5 does with it. 

This way I can run it in node-debug, and step through the process, and see what might be going wrong, or right. 

I wanted to throw this over the fence so I'd be able to find it easily later, and in case there are any Node devs out there who quickly want to find out what's going on with a specific feed.

Note that functional parts of addToRiver are commented out, the parts that save the bits off in different folders. This is for debugging the parsing.
